## Automation and Artificial Intelligence: A Political Perspective

In discussions of the effects of automation and artificial intelligence on society and the economy, futurists, technological leaders, and economists often stress the need for government action in order to prepare for and alleviate the potentially disastrous changes that will occur. The purpose of this research report will be to highlight the political ramifications of automation and artificial intelligence, as well possible solutions to the problems that these increasingly advanced technologies will bring. To truly understand what actions the government should take to best prepare its citizenry for the new economy, it’s vital to have an understanding of the full range of effects these new technologies will bring upon society.

Artificial intelligence researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee envision tremendous benefits to society from advances in artificial intelligence and robotics, which they label as “Bounty” in their book, “The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity, in a Time of Brilliant Technologies”. They cite widespread access to information from sources such as Wikipedia (which has the equivalent amount of information as 50 Encyclopedia Britannicas) and the fact that today mobile phones are more widespread than electricity and clean water as promising signs of an increasingly innovative future economy (Brynjolfsson, McAfee 108). These authors also cite improvements in the quality of life which can’t be measured in GDP, such as the ability to have a Skype chat with one’s kids, a luxury even the Rockefeller’s couldn’t have afforded. Yet these researchers from MIT also predict skyrocketing levels of wealth inequality from the creation of new technologies, which they label as “The Spread”, a force which has devastated the middle class of America and committed tremendous harm to the stability of democracies around the world (Brynjolfsson, McAfee 126).

The reason for rising income inequality is job polarization, which results from the automation of routine jobs—which can be done more efficiently and accurately by machines than humans–and the increasing demand for highly skilled workers who can create innovative technologies. While 50,000 factories have fled the country since the beginning of the 21st century, squeezing middle-class workers in this country, Facebook—the innovative social-media giant—has alone produced seven billionaires (Yu). “The Spread” isn’t only unique to the United States, however, and it’s not caused purely by institutional factors such as our tax policy as can be seen from rising inequality in other nations such as Germany, Sweden, and Finland; new technologies are the primary motivators for this change (Brynjolfsson, McAfee 126). 

But some contest that the fear of these new age technologies is overblown, and that the government shouldn’t try to alleviate a problem which won’t cause much damage. Recently, when the automated teller machine (ATM) was invented, people thought that human bank tellers would become obsolete and thus be wiped off of the job market (Automation and Anxiety). While per branch, bank tellers became less prevalent, their numbers actually increased in total as banks became more profitable and started opening up more branches. Bank employees were able to work less on routine work and more in sales and customer service, fields which are less easily done by machines. Technology has always found a way to create more jobs than it destroys, economist David Autor from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology argues, as automation increases the demand of workers who focus on tasks machines can’t accomplish.

Yet undiscussed by these individuals is the amount of wrenching pain inflicted on those who weren’t able to adapt to the past society’s changing technologies. As CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Oren Etzioni, states: “Oh, we survived the Industrial Revolution, sure we did. But millions of people suffered tremendous hardship. This revolution could be faster and sharper and more devastating” (McFarland). With technological leaders pouring billions of dollars into self-driving cars, truck and taxi drivers are at a huge risk of losing their jobs, joining the millions of manufacturing workers whose jobs were gutted by global trade deals and automated machines. Today, money is being centralized into the pockets of innovative digital entrepreneurs, who operate in mostly winner-take-all markets, as can be seen with Google in the search engine industry and Microsoft in the operating system industry, further worsening wealth inequality.

Authors of Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty, Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson, oppose increasing wealth inequality, which in their opinion weakens a cornerstone of democracy: the middle class. In Chapter 8 of their book, “Political Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy”, these authors argue that the middle class plays a vital role in democracy, acting as a buffer between the rich and poor (Acemoglu, Robinson). In highly unequal societies, democracy isn’t a viable political system because the rich would have to enact highly redistributive policies to appease the poor and prevent violent revolution—an existential risk which could wipe them out of power. While they might appease the poor in the beginning, the rich would inevitably switch to repressing the poor, as they would lose much more from appeasing its poor than from repressing them—often through violent means. When the middle class is strong and wealthy, however, the rich are more willing to democratize their society, with the knowledge that there taxes won’t be too high in a democracy. Yet when the middle class is weak, the rich face a much higher cost from democratizing society, and instead will risk repressing its people, with the knowledge that they could be wiped out during a revolution, in order to not pay the heavy cost of redistribution. These conclusions help explain why revolutions typically occur in underdeveloped nations with abysmal middle classes.

One solution to strengthen the middle class and preserve democracy–championed by futurists, technological leaders, and economists, such as Elon Musk and Sam Altman–is the creation of a universal basic income (Weller). The idea of a universal basic income (UBI) has been championed by those on the left and right of the political spectrum. Martin Luther King Jr. and Lyndon B. Johnson both advocated for the UBI in the 1960’s in preparation for a world that would require less and less human labor, and thus could potentially create an unskilled underclass. Those on the right, such as free-market thinkers Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek also championed the universal basic income in the form of a negative income tax, in the belief that welfare is demeaning as well as horribly inefficient (Griffith). While SNAP food stamps spend over 15% on administrative costs, the Earned Income Tax Credit–a watered down version of Friedman’s negative income tax—only spends 1.5% on administrative costs. With artificial intelligence taking over higher and higher skilled jobs, the value of our underskilled labor plummets, and thus to prevent mass poverty, the universal income may become necessary.

But the universal income also has its critics. Some say that implementing a UBI would change the relationship between government and citizens, decreasing the incentive for citizens to work and turning the government into a provider (Cass). The UBI would also require a massive budget increase, especially without drastic changes to Social Security and Medicare. Under a system with a UBI, these social insurance programs would be unneeded, yet because of their popularity it would be incredibly hard to cut these programs. Practically, all we could do is add the UBI to our country’s arsenal of welfare programs, which undercuts one of the main selling points of the UBI, which is to eliminate the inefficiency of the welfare state. As President Obama has stated: “Whether a universal income is the right model – is it gonna be accepted by a broad base of people? – that’s a debate that we’ll be having over the next 10 or 20 years” (McFarland). In order for our society to be prepared for future technologies, we must consider the positives and negatives of implementing a universal basic income.

As our world evolves to match the rise of rapidly advancing technologies, it's vital that our government works to make the transition as smooth as possible. Whether out of a moral responsibility to its people, or solely to preserve democracy, our representatives must fight to limit skyrocketing income inequality, creating policies which allow everyone to benefit from the bounty of the new machine age.

## Effects of AI/Automation in Politics
As Mike and Max pointed out, the middle and poorer classes of this country have been hurting because of new technologies which make skilled workers vastly more productive, but require less and less unskilled/routine labor. [median wage fact](http://www.epi.org/productivity-pay-gap/). While productivity rose 73% in the last 40 years, median wages rose only 11% in that timespan, leading to a frustration of many Americans at essentially stagnate wages. They've taken their anger out on the political system.

In November of 2015, Congress' job approval rating was at an abysmal 11%, showing American's distrust of our government and hatred towards the status quo. As can be seen by Brexit and other political movements around the world, people want change, which is definitely a result of the social unrest caused by a declining middle class.

Besides inspiring political movements against the status quo, the weakening of the middle class has, MIT economists and authors of Why Nations Fail argue, led to the destabilization of democracy. In their paper, The Political Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy, these authors argue that the middle class is vital to democracy, acting as a buffer between the poor and rich. When the middle class is poor and small, the rich are less likely to democratize, because their taxes would be sky-high in a democracy to pay for redistributive policies which help the poor and win their votes. Instead of incurring the heavy cost of redistributive policies, the rich would instead use often repression repression to block the poor from voting, as can be seen in the political history of South America countries. When the middle class is large and wealthy, however, the rich are very likely to democratize because they know in a democracy their taxes wouldn't be too high and they could forego the risk of a system-toppling revolution.

Now that we've analyzed the major consequences of artificial intelligence and automation, Max will begin by introducing our solutions.


## Government's role for easier transition
As Max mentioned, education is vital for adapting to the new economy. One aspect of our solution that we agreed upon is re-education and job retraining for currently unskilled workers, who occupy fields such as manufacturing and soon to be truck driving (which is america's most common job). We see it as the responsibility of everyone, including the government, private corporations, and individuals to future-proof themselves, though there are specific areas where we think the government should take initiative. We believe that the government should heavily invest in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCS), which democratize education by taking away the price barrier and allow people from slums to learn from the world's greatest professors. It also allows people who graduate highschool to further their education at a low cost, continually adapting to the changing economy. To allow currently unskilled workers to quit their jobs and pursue job retraining, we believe that the government should also enact either a universal basic income or negative income tax, which would give workers economic freedom to further their education and contribute to the economy. Politically, the UBI has bipartisan support and has been implemented in Canada, India, and Denmark, with heavy consideration by the EU AI conference.  


## Conclusions
Our main weaknesses were centered around the lack of academic resources and research journals that pertained to artificial intelligence and automation. Many major developments of artificial intelligence such as the development of the self-driving car were created recently, and thus there hasn't been enough to analyze their impacts and prescribe solutions.

Another weakness is inherent of our topic. We can't foresee the skills that will be necessary 10 years in the future as our technology and processing power is rapidly improving. We didn't know 50 years ago that computer game developers would be an important profession. All we can do is give our students creativity and the ability to adapt by thereselves.   

#### Random
With the loss of 50,000 manufacturing plants in the first decade of the 21st century due to automation and global trade deals, our country's economy has lost millions of decent paying jobs (ranging in price, but averaging three times minimum wage) often with benefits, devastating the middle class.

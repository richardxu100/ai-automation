## Effects of AI/Automation in Politics
The political effect of a declining middle class, with the disappearance of 5 million blue-collar manufacturing jobs since 2000, has been a raging anger towards the establishment (who represent the status quo), with the approval ratings of business interests such as the health insurance industry and politicians plummeting to their lowest numbers in [record](http://www.opposingviews.com/i/politics/americans-have-little-trust-government-big-business).

This has led to the rise of anti-establishment movements, such as Brexit and Donald Trump's presidential campaign, which ended up sending political shockwaves throughout the globe. For a variety of reasons, largely driven by economic factors, people want change.

Authors of Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty, Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson, argue in their book "Political Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy" the vital role that the middle class plays in democracy. The middle class acts as buffer between the rich and poor. When the middle class is small and poor, the redistributive policies required to maintain democracy are too costly for the rich, and thus they use repression (often violent) to maintain power. But when the middle class is large and wealthy, the rich are incentivized to democratize because they know their taxes won't be so high with a wealthy middle class, and they'll be able to stave off the threat of revolution.

This is why we believe that public educational reform is critical; it protects and future proofs the middle class, strengthening democracy.

## Government's role for easier transition
We see it as the government's responsibility to reform the current educational system to prepare the next generation of citizens for the future economy. But we also believe that the government should alleviate the pain and disruption faced by those currently unprepared (unskilled workers) for the future economy. We believe that it's a good idea to implement a Universal Basic Income (UBI) to allow unskilled workers to either undergo job training or enroll in university classes to prepare themselves to work with routine AI. It would allow for healthy frictional unemployment, as unskilled workers would be able to quit their old jobs to further their education.

The UBI has bipartisan support, with Milton Friedman advocating for a UBI derivative (negative income tax), MLK, and futurists such as Elon Musk advocating for the UBI. It's been implemented in Canada, India, and Denmark, and is under heavy consideration by the EU AI conference officials (look into). It will also help make sure that the benefits and opportunities of new technologies will be able to be experienced by everyone.  

### Concessions
Our main weaknesses were centered around the lack of academic resources and research journals that pertained to artificial intelligence and automation. Many major developments of artificial intelligence such as the development of the self-driving car were created recently, and thus there hasn't been enough to analyze their impacts and prescribe solutions. 

Another weakness is inherent of our topic. We can't foresee the skills that will be necessary 10 years in the future as our technology and processing power is rapidly improving. We didn't know 50 years ago that computer game developers would be an important profession. All we can do is give our students creativity and the ability to adapt by thereselves.   

#### Random
With the loss of 50,000 manufacturing plants in the first decade of the 21st century due to automation and global trade deals, our country's economy has lost millions of decent paying jobs (ranging in price, but averaging three times minimum wage) often with benefits, devastating the middle class.

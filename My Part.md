## Effects of AI/Automation in Politics
With the loss of 50,000 manufacturing plants in the first decade of the 21st century due to automation and global trade deals, our country's economy has lost millions of decent paying jobs (ranging in price, but averaging three times minimum wage) often with benefits, devastating the middle class.

The political effect has been a raging anger targeted at the establishment (who represent the status quo), with the approval ratings of business interests such as the health insurance industry and politicians plummeting to their lowest numbers in [record](http://www.opposingviews.com/i/politics/americans-have-little-trust-government-big-business).

This has led to the rise of anti-establishment movements, such as Brexit and Donald Trump's presidential campaign, which ended up sending political shockwaves throughout the globe. For a variety of reasons, largely driven by economic factors, people want change.-

Authors of Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty, Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson, argue in their book "Political Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy" the vital role that the middle class plays in democracy. Middle class is a buffer between the rich and poor. When the middle class is small and poor, the rich are able to disenfranchise the poor through repression, and maintain power. Democracy and redistributive policies are too costly, so to prevent revolution, the rich use repression. But when the middle class is large and wealthy, the rich are incentivized to democratize because they know their taxes won't be so high with a wealthy middle class.

This is why we believe that protecting the middle class through educational efforts is vital in order to maintain a healthy democracy.

## Government's role for easier transition
We see it as the government's responsibility to reform the current educational system to prepare the next generation of citizens for the future economy. But we also believe that the government should alleviate the pain and disruption faced by those currently unprepared (unskilled workers) for the future economy. We believe that it's a good idea to implement a Universal Basic Income (UBI) to allow unskilled workers to either undergo job training or enroll in university classes. It would allow for healthy frictional unemployment, as unskilled workers won't have to juggle their old jobs with furthering their education.

The UBI has bipartisan support, with Milton Friedman advocating for a UBI derivative (negative income tax), MLK, and futurists such as Elon Musk advocating for the UBI. It will also help make sure that the benefits and opportunities of new technologies will be able to be experienced by everyone.
